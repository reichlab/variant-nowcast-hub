This directory contains an example of the files downloaded and generated by the assign_clades.py script.

- ncbi_dataset is the unzipped version of the genbank sequence "package" downloaded via the datasets cli (minus the actual sequences, which are too large for git)
- ncbi_metadata.tsv contains information about each genbank sequence downloaded via the datasets cli
- clade_assignments.csv is the output of the nextclade cli run that assigned each of the downloaded sequences to a clade
