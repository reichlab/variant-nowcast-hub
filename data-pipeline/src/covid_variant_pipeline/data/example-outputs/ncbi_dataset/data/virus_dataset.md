The NCBI Datasets Project has developed virus-specific genome and protein datasets, initially limited to the Coronaviridae (NCBI Taxonomy ID: 11118) family of viruses, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Viral genome data is currently limited to all Coronaviridae (Taxonomy ID: 11118) including SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2, Taxonomy ID: 2697049).

Viral protein data is currently limited to SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) only.

To request SARS-CoV-2 protein data, you must use one of the following one-word terms, with one allowed term per protein: orf1ab (orf1ab polyprotein), orf1a (orf1a polyprotein), nsp1 (leader protein), nsp2, nsp3, nsp4, nsp5 (3C-like proteinase), nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp10, RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or nsp12), nsp11, nsp13 (helicase), nsp14 (3'-to-5' exonuclease), nsp15 (endoRNAse), nsp16 (2'-O-ribose methyltransferase), S (surface glycoprotein or spike protein), ORF3a, E (envelope protein or ORF4), M (membrane glycoprotein or ORF5), ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, N (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein or ORF9), ORF10.

The table below describes the contents of each of the files that may be included in your download.
