methods: "A Bayesian hierarchical multinomial logistic regression (MLR) model with Dirichlet-Multinomial observation process and location-specific concentration parameters. The model uses hierarchical hyperpriors on intercepts (alpha) and slopes (beta) to enable partial pooling across locations and clades. Location-specific concentration parameters allow the model to adaptively learn appropriate uncertainty levels for each location based on data characteristics. Linear trends are modeled in logit space with standardized time variables. Implemented using PyMC with NUTS sampling (15,000 draws, 3,000 warmup, 1 chain)."
