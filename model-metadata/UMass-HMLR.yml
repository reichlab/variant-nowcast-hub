methods: "A Bayesian hierarchical multinomial logistic regression (HMLR) model for nowcasting COVID variants. Regression coefficents are modeled hierarchically across variants and locations. Model is adapted from the HMLR model from Abousamra, Figgins and Bedford (PLOS Computational Biology, 2024), which uses hierarchies across location, but not across different variants."
